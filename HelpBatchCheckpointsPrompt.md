## what is this all about?

This script allows you to try different checkpoints with different prompts. Each checkpoint can have its own prompt, or the prompt from the positive prompt field is inserted into the checkpoint-specific prompt at a position you specify.

<hr>

## checkpoint names
either enter the names of the checkpoints yourself, keep in mind that if you have sorted them into sub-folders, you have to add the sub-folders to the name, or press this ðŸ“’ button next to the box and all existing checkpoints will be loaded into the textbox.

### syntax:
- `checkpointA, checkpointB` Separate the checkpoint names with a comma.
 - `@index:number` Is automatically added after the checkpoint name when you load the checkpoint by ðŸ“’ button. Ignored by the program, but can help you to see which checkpoint belongs to which prompt.

<hr>

## Prompts/prompt templates for Checkpoints
here you enter the prompts for the checkpoints, each in the same order as the checkpoints are.
If you have installed the [Civitai Helper](https://github.com/butaixianran/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper) extension, this button automatically launches the prompts from the checkpoint thumbnails into the textbox.
If you don't have this installed it will simply load `{prompt};` for each checkpoint. Just like if there is no prompt for the preview image.

hires fix always uses the same prompts as for the first pass of the checkpoint, even if extra hires fix prompts were specified.
### syntax:
- `promptA; promptB` Separate the prompts with a semicolon.
- `@index:number` Is automatically added after the checkpoint name when you load the checkpoint by ðŸ“’ button.
- `{prompt}` insert this at the point in the checkpoint specific prompt where you want the positive prompt to be inserted.
- `{{size:WIDTHxHEIGHT}}` defines the size of the image. When not set, the default size is set in the UI.
- `{{count:number}}` Add this to the end of the prompt to set a different batch count for this checkpoint
- `{{clip_skip:number}}` Add this to the end of the prompt to set a different clip skip for this checkpoint
- `{{neg: negativ prompt text here}}`Add this to the end of the prompt, the text will be simply added to the back of the negative prompt
- `{{style:StyleName}}` Add this to your prompt to use a Style saved in A1111. If you have `{prompt}` in your style and your prompt template looks something like `template prompt {{style:StyleName}}` the end prompt will look like `part of the style before {prompt}, prompt template, base prompt, part of the style prompt after {prompt}`

These can be changed in the setting. **you need to know Regexp to use this!** Look at the code in BatchParams.py to see how it works internally.

**SDXL:** If you use SDXL and 1.X/2.X checkpoints set the *VAE* to `Automatic` and set the appropriate sizes for each prompt.
<hr>

ðŸ”¢ adds the `@index:number` to the end of the Checkpoints and Prompts. If already there updates them.
<hr>

## Grid margins (px)
specifies how many pixels should be between the checkpoint images in the grid created in the end

<hr>

## save
You can save the state. Use a unique name for this. I.e. no duplicate names. Press the ðŸ’¾ button to save.
- To overwrite a saved state, check the `Overwrite existing save` checkbox and press the ðŸ’¾ button.
- To append to a saved state, check the `append existing save` checkbox and press the ðŸ’¾ button.

### load
To reload a saved state, select it from the drop-down menu and press the ðŸ“’ button. This is a multiple selection menu, but only the first selection is taken into account.
To load new saves, press the ðŸ”„ button before selecting a save from the drop-down menu.

<hr>

## advanced settings
The basismodel version of the checkpoint can now be inserted with the ðŸ”¢ button next to the index, but this is quite slow and takes about 5 minutes on my system with 90 checkpoints. To enable this check under advanced settings the checkbox `Add model version to checkpoint names`.
